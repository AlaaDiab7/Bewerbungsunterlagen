Taipei 101 (Chinese: 台北101; pinyin: Táiběi 101; stylized in all caps),[1] formerly known as the Taipei World Financial Center, is a 508.0 m (1,667 ft), 101-story skyscraper in Taipei, Taiwan. 
It is owned by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. 
The building was officially classified as the world's tallest from its opening on 31 December 2004 (in time to celebrate New Year's Eve). 
However, the Burj Khalifa surpassed Taipei 101 in 2010.[11] 
The construction of Taipei 101 was a joint venture led by Kumagai Gumi, a Japanese construction company, in cooperation with Samsung C&T of South Korea. 
Upon completion, it became the world's first skyscraper to exceed a height of half a kilometer (about 0.3 miles). 
As of 2023, Taipei 101 is the tallest building in Taiwan and the eleventh tallest building in the world.[12][13] 
The skyscraper celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024. 

The building's high-speed elevators, manufactured by Toshiba of Japan, held the record for the fastest in the world at the time of completion.

The elevators of Taipei 101 that transport passengers from the 5th to the 89th floor in 37 seconds (attaining 60.6 km/h (37.7 mph)) set speed records.[12][a] 
In 2011, Taipei 101 was awarded a Platinum certificate rating under the LEED certification system for energy efficiency and environmental design, becoming the tallest and largest green building in the world.[14] 
The structure regularly appears as an icon of Taipei in international media, and the Taipei 101 fireworks displays are a regular feature of New Year's Eve broadcasts and celebrations.

Taipei 101's postmodernist architectural style evokes traditional Asian aesthetics in a modern structure employing industrial materials. 
Its design incorporates a number of features that enable the structure to withstand the Pacific Ring of Fire's earthquakes and the region's tropical storms. 
The tower houses offices, restaurants, shops, and indoor and outdoor observatories. 
The tower is adjoined by a multilevel shopping mall that has the world's largest ruyi symbol as an exterior feature.
